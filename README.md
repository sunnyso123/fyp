This is my final year project which is a VR serious game for raising awareness of fire safety.

In today’s Hong Kong society, fire safety has usually been neglected by the majority of the people.
Although the Hong Kong government has been doing a lot of work to promote the importance of fire safety, the number of fire outbreaks still remains large.
Most of the fire outbreaks occur in the citizens’ houses.
The potential reason for this could be the carelessness in handling the household fire safety issues.
To effectively increase citizens’ awareness toward fire safety issues, a VR fire safety serious game is proposed for fire safety education.
The game will focus on imparting the knowledge of general fire safety practices, evacuation drills and firefighting skills to the public.
Players will wear a VR headset and use a pair of controllers to interact with the game objects so as to finish different pieces of training.
It is hoped that the Hong Kong government would adopt the idea of the game to better promote fire safety.
